To install:
1) Go to the File -> Plugins dialog
2) Select "Add".
3) Enter the plugin folder (which is probably called ATCP.plugin)
4) Select the 'plugin.xml' file.

This plugin should be installed before connecting, and should not be removed or
disabled while connected.

This script is based off of Trevize's ATCP plugin, which was based off of
Keldar's.
